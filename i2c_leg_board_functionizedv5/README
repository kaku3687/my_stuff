I2C Leg Board Functionalized v3

* Getting the code to compile with a fresh installation of Energia

** Get TwoMsTimer.h/.cpp

Download (or clone) https://github.com/freemansoft/build-monitor-devices to get
https://github.com/freemansoft/build-monitor-devices/tree/master/ti_launchpad_rgb,
then add TwoMsTimer.h and TwoMsTimer.cpp to Library

(in my case,
=/Users/Applications/Energia.app/Contents/Resources/Java/hardware/msp430/libraries/TwoMsTimer/=,
but for users of Linux and Windows, it's probably a little different)

** Resolve compilation errors related to redefinitions within pins_energia.h

This was a result of your (my) being an idiot: make sure the board is
"LaunchPad w/ msp430g2553 (16MHz)"
